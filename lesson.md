# Vue.js (CDN) Lesson Plan

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Vue.js

### Objective
Understand what Vue.js is and why it's used.

- What is Vue.js? (Lightweight JavaScript framework)
- Key features of Vue.js (reactivity, component-based)
- Why use Vue.js? (simplicity, flexibility)

### Setup
- Include Vue.js via CDN.
- Simple HTML file to display Vue integration.

### Hands-on
- Create a Vue instance.
- Bind data to HTML (`{{ message }}`).

---

## Lesson 2: Vue Directives

### Objective
Learn how to use Vue directives.

- `v-bind`: Binding attributes.
- `v-model`: Two-way data binding.
- `v-if`, `v-else`, `v-else-if`: Conditional rendering.
- `v-for`: List rendering.

### Hands-on
- Create a form with `v-model`.
- Display a list dynamically using `v-for`.
- Show/hide elements using `v-if`.

---

## Lesson 3: Event Handling

### Objective
Handle user interactions with Vue.js.

- `v-on`: Listening to events.
- Method creation and invocation.
- Event modifiers (e.g., `.prevent`, `.stop`).

### Hands-on
- Create a button to update a value.
- Build an interactive form with validation.

---

## Lesson 4: Computed Properties and Watchers

### Objective
Use computed properties and watchers for reactivity.

- Computed properties for derived state.
- Watchers for asynchronous tasks.

### Hands-on
- Create a computed property to calculate totals.
- Use a watcher to log changes in a form.

---

## Lesson 5: Components (Introduction)

### Objective
Break the UI into reusable components.

- Create and register a component.
- Use `props` to pass data to components.

### Hands-on
- Build a parent-child component example (e.g., product list).

---

## Lesson 6: Styling and Dynamic Classes

### Objective
Learn how to apply dynamic styling.

- Binding classes and styles.
- Conditional classes.

### Hands-on
- Highlight selected items in a list.
- Add a theme toggle button.

---

## Lesson 7: Lifecycle Hooks

### Objective
Understand the Vue component lifecycle.

- Lifecycle hooks: `created`, `mounted`, `updated`, `destroyed`.

### Hands-on
- Log lifecycle hooks for debugging.
- Fetch data using `mounted`.

---

## Lesson 8: Project

### Objective
Apply everything learned to build a small project.

- **Project idea**: To-Do List or Weather App.
- **Features**: Add, remove, and edit items dynamically.
- Use computed properties, watchers, and conditional rendering.

### Guided Implementation
- Step-by-step project building.
